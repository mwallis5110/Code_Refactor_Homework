#Horiseon Website Project

This is the finished code for the Horiseon website. It is meant to serve as a marketing tool for them to advertise their services and explain the intended benefits to their customers.

The site is built using a combination of HTML and CSS, stored in their respective files.

I was assigned to refactor the finished code to improve efficiency, accessability and functionality. As of 6/23/21, this task is complete.

Changes made include:

    -Adding alt tags to each image
    -Consolidating CSS elements
    -Adjusting CSS structure to better correspond with its' respective HTML elements

Before Images:

These are just a few examples of CSS code prior to refactoring. As you can see, these elements can easily be consolidated
